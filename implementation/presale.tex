To implement fair odds for the presale lottery, a user can only place one buy order for one ticket. The buy order will be placed in a list on the blockchain. Every new buy order will just be appended to the list. Whenever the presale is over, and the lottery is triggered, a random number in the range of the number of buy orders is generated. The list of buy orders will then be made to a ring by connecting the head with the tail. The winner of the lottery will then be the n guest starting at the index in the ring that has been generated by the random number, where n is the amount of tickets available. 

This ensures fair odds for everybody and also lets people that want to attend an event together maximize the chance that both win the lottery, by placing their buy order at the same time and therefor try to get a place in the list next to each other.
