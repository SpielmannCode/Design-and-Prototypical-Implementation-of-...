\subsection{Buy a Ticket}
Figure \ref{fig:buyticket-sequence-diagram} shows the process, when a guest buys a ticket. The smart contract locks the price in ETH until the event has passed. Since a smart contract cannot initiate a transaction itself, the host has to request the now unlocked ETH from smart contract to initiate the payment.
