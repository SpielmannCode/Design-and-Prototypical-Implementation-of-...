\section{Presale}\label{section:des:presale}
Whenever an event takes place and the demand for the tickets is high, the potential guests will all try to buy the tickets when the sale period starts. This leads to a high traffic on the ticket sellers website. It it is then also not clear, which person can finish the buying process and is often determined by the quality of their internet provider.

To prevent this problem and have fair and clear odds for every potential guest, it was decided to use a lottery system for the initial sale of the tickets. Every guest, that wants to attend the event, can place a buy order in the presale. This order will cost as much as the ticket. At the end of the presale period, the tickets will be distributed using a random number, In the case a guest has not won a ticket, he then will be abke to reclaim the spend money. If there are more tickets than guest in the presale, everybody will get a ticket. 

 A guest will only be able to place a single buy order for only one ticket, since a fair lottery for multiple tickets is not possible on the blockchain.
