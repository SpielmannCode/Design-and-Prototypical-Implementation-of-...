The ticketing industry is and has long been subject to counterfeiting and profiteering. The secondary market for high demand events attracts ticket scalpers, that hoard tickets and try to sell them at prices well above the initial value. This can be seen as a normal market force, that allows quick movers to make a profit. However, it is a concern for many artists and organizers who lose control over their ticket pricing and distribution. For example, Ed Sheeran's Benefit Concert at Albert Hall (UK) in 2017 for the Teenage Cancer Trust was abused for heavy profiteering where tickets with a face value of 75 pounds have been resold for up to 2330 pounds \cite{ed-sheeran-concert-ticket-prices}. Beyond the reputation problem and fairness concern, the secondary market is also problematic due to fraud. Tickets are often fake or have already been used rendering them invalid. 

Blockchain technology offers an opportunity to remedy these issues. In this project an open and decentralized platform for distributing event tickets and regulating the aftermarket is designed, implemented and evaluated. The system operates through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to verify the validity of tickets for a given event, ending counterfeit tickets and allowing the secure resale of tickets based on the organizers pricing to avoid ticket scalping. Furthermore, a mechanism to help users detect fraudulent events is discussed. Also, a system that invalidates tickets in a fast and efficient manner is designed and implemented.
