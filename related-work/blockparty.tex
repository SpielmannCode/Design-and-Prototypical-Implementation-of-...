\paragraph{Ticket Transfer} Blockparty allows tickets to be transferred directly from your account to another phone number.


\paragraph{Ticket Validation} Blockparty takes the encrypted key of a ticket holder's digital identity and associates it with the QR code of the ticket. How this is done in detail is not described. With a blockchain ledger they track transfers per ticket and hence, the newest owner of the ticket. For the on site ticket validation, Blockparty provides a secondary app called \textit{Blockparty Enterprise Scanner}. It is meant for event organizers using it to scan these codes in the ledger to validate tickets and grant access to the holders.
