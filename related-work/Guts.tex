\section{Guts}
Guts is a company from the Netherlands. They are using the Guaranteed Entrance Token(GET) developed by the GET Foundation. The main goal of Guts is to prevent a secondary black market. By making the ticket bound to a smart contract, they only allow the tickets to be resold over the smart contract at a predetermined price, therefore making it impossible to resell a ticket with a markup.

\paragraph{Identity}
Whenever a user is registering at Guts, he needs to verify his phone number and register an account. The identity of the user is linked to his phone number. Guts then creates a Ethereum wallet for every user. However, the private key of this wallet is not provided to the end user, but rather stored by Guts. There is no way for the user to get access to his Ethereum wallet. 


\paragraph{Storage}
Guts stores all their data on their own servers. The tickets themselves are stored on the Ethereum block chain. All change of ownership are protocolled on the block chain. During the validation of the ticket when entering the venue, the validation of the tickets is done of chain, because the entrance control needs to be very fast and Guts does not yet believe, that the Ethereum block chain is able to handle such a high load of transactions.
