\subsection{Random Number Manipulation}\label{subsection:random-number-manipulation}
Since the distribution of the tickets has to be fair, it is needed to use a random number as a seed for the lottery of the tickets. This random number has to be the same for all the nodes in the blockchain. One way of achieving such a random number generation, is the usage of the hash of a block n-blocks after the current block in the chain. This introduces the problem, that a miner may not publish the block, whenever the random number is not in his favour. 

This stated problem can be addressed by ensuring the reward for mining the block is higher than the reward of cheating the lottery.
