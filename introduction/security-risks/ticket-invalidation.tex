\subsection{Ticket Invalidation}\label{subsection:ticket-invalidation}

When a guest enters with a valid ticket, this ticket somehow has to be marked as used, in order to prevent it from being used multiple times. To change the state of a ticket on the BC a transaction has to be sent and this transaction is put in a queue to be mined and validated. This takes some time and how long it takes depends on how much GAS is paid for this transaction. During this time it could be possible for a guest that has just entered the event to offer his ticket for sale and attach a relatively high GAS fee to the transaction. This high GAS fee would then lead to the ticket being transferred very fast. While the transaction, that marks the ticket as used, is not yet mined, the new owner of this ticket could enter the event and the ticket would have been used twice.
