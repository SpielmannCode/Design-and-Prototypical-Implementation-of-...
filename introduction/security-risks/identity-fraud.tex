\subsection{Identity Fraud}\label{subsection:identity-fraud}

An event host may want to provide guests a fair and neat ticket buying experience for high-demand events. To pursue this, a buyer could be asked to provide his identity in some form. This may prevent bulk-buying bots, but if this form of identity is only weakly linked to a human, such as a mobile phone number, scalpers could still buy cheap prepaid sim cards, buy multiple tickets linked to these sim cards and sell those on the black market.
