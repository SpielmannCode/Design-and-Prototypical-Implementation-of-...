\section{Backend}
To run the backend applications locally (Identity Approver\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bc-ticketing/identity-approver}} and Access Control\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bc-ticketing/host-backend}}), download the sample docker compose files from the github repos, provide the required environment variables, rename them to docker-compose.yml and start the services using docker-compose. You need to save each docker-compose.yml into a separate folder.
